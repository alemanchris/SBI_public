DESCRIPTION
SBI_norm calls functions:
    -smooth_ts: Smooths series, using a chosen smoother
    -norm_func: Performs normalization C to T and T to C, computes policy estimates and
        figures, see, figure index at the end.
    -bb_perform: Boostraps results from norm_func
OPTPUT OF THE CODE:
    - Table of results with bootstrap 90% CI
    - Normalization figures


User can choose between linear nm = 2 or quadratic nm = 3 time stage
transform

INPUTS: 
    Required inputs
        -idta: Outcome Variable of two regions, Tx2 Matrix, where T (time observations e.g
        year) 
        -itm: Time units Tx1 (Years, Months Days, etc)
        -itp: Policy date (date after which one expects policy effects to be non-zero)
    Optional inputs
        Normalization options: 
        -inm:   2: (Default)Time stage transform 3:quadratic time stage transform 
        -ismo:  1: (Default)Smoothing 0: No smoothing
        -itsmo: Type of smoother
        -ici:   CI bands threshold (DEFAULT 0.1 that is 90% Bands)
            (you can change the default values manually, in section "Options for smoothing" )
            0: Moving average, with windown = 9;
            1: Interpolation smoother CSAPS (DEFAULT) with smoothing parameter = 0.0008
            2: Chebyshev nodes with Cheby Regression
            3: B-Splines
            4: HP filter (lambda=50)
        -ib : 0: No bootstrap 1: Boostrap (DEFAULT)
        Labels
        -irnam: Region labels
        -itnam: Time label
        -ionam: Outcome label

OUTPUT: 
    -psi_esti: Nx3 Mapping parameters 
    -pol_esti: Nx1 Policy Estimate in log difference
    -tp_norm1: Nx1 Location of policy date after normalization
    -fp_norm:  Nx1 Location of the first point in C to time of T
    -l_opt:    Nx1 Lenght of the overlap interval 
    -flag :    Nx1 1:Mapping didnt converge 2:Mapping delivers non-sence

Figure 1 has the option to have the mapping parameters in the
title, for this set opt.title_coeff=1

REMARKS: 
-Trimming(anchor) is optional, to trim select par.cut>0
-Local minizer is implemented

Before you run the this routine, make sure you have the following:
-At least two regions and their respective population
-Date of NATIONWIDE policy implementation. (itp)

Left to implement in this routine:
1. Input more than two regions
