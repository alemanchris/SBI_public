 The following examples illustrate the use of the routine:
 SBI_nrm.m, that implements the Stage Based Identification methods in
 Aleman,  Busch,  Ludwig,  and  Santaeul`alia-Llopis  (2023)

 EXAMPLE 1:
 -----------
 Standalone, just run EXAMPLE1.m
 
 DESCRIPTION:  Uses example data to run SBI
 
 
 -----------
 EXAMPLE 2:
 -----------
 Standalone, just run EXAMPLE2.m
 
 DESCRIPTION:  Exact identification using a polynomial of degree 3 as the data generating process. This also serves as a placebo example, the policy effect is zero thus  estimated effect should be zero.
 

 -----------
 EXAMPLE 3:
 -----------
 Standalone, just run EXAMPLE3.m
 
 DESCRIPTION: Exact identification using GLF(Generalized Logistic Func) with as the data generatig process. This also serves as a placebo example, the policy effect is zero thus estimated effect should be zero.
