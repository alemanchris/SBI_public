ATTENTION! 
BEFORE YOU RUN THIS ROUTINE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING: 
-Time series data for two regions, save your data in the /input/ folder.
-Date of NATIONWIDE policy implementation. (itp)
-Create an 'input', 'output' folder, SBI_nrm.m will save results in these folders
Technical Requirements: 
(1)This routine has been tested using MATLAB 2020b
(2)Requires the optimization, global optimization and curvefitting
toolboxes

DESCRIPTION
SBI_nrm.m calls functions:
    -smooth_ts: Smooths series, using a chosen smoother
    -norm_func: Performs normalization C to T and T to C, computes policy estimates and
        figures, see, figure index at the end.
    -bb_perform: Boostraps results from norm_func
OUTPUT OF THE CODE:
    - Table of results with bootstrap 90% CI (also in Latex format)
    - Normalization figures
    - Saves diary in output/diary_SBI.txt 

User can choose between linear nmts = 1 or quadratic nmts = 2 stage time
transform
User can choose between Proportional Level adjustment nmlv = 1 or proportional plus aditive = 2 
WARNING!
if nmts = 2, the inverse t^-1(s) is aproximated by a quadratic fit, results
are reported accordingly, thus the parameters cannot be interpreted in the
same way as in the linear case

INPUTS:
