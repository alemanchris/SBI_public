 The goal of the following examples is to illustrate the use of the routine:
 SBI_nrm.m, that implements the Stage Based Identification method in
 Aleman,  Busch,  Ludwig,  and  Santaeul`alia-Llopis  (2020)  
 Any comments please address them to christian.c.aleman[at]gmail.com
 Use SBI_nrm.m at your discretion
 

 EXAMPLE 1:
 You should execute EXAMPLE1.m: Uses example data to run SBI

 EXAMPLE 2:
 You should execute EXAMPLE2.m:
 Runs the exact identification example, using GLF as the data generatig process.
 This also serves as a placebo example, the policy effect is zero thus
 estimated effect should be zero.
